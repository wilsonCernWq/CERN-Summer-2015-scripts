Instruction for version 2
	    usage: <script-name> <output-sample> <variable-definitions> <output-prefix> <output-suffix>
	    example:
		./proc_macro.py qiwu_test.in var_defs.xml output/gear .xml

In variable definition you can define functions (including constant function) like this:
<var>
  local_var = ... , (avoid rename global variable cause it would overwrite them)
  rank = ... , (default = 1)
  func = ... , (check local scope first then global scope)
<var>

or a short cut for constants

<var> ... <var>

The script could replace the variables defined in sample file by their values and generate N0 * N1 * ... NN outputs with name: <prefix>-(num)-<suffix>, where {Ni} are the ranks of all variables. The program will loop all the possible integer 'x' value according to their ranks.
